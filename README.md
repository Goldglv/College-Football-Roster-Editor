# College-Football-Roster-Editor
College Football USA 97 Roster Editor for Sega Genesis

This app will enable you to update Rosters for the following Systems/College Football USA Games:

Sega Genesis/Megadrive
College Football USA '97

The Editor will automatically remove the checksum for all games listed above so you should have no issue running the game after you modify the ROM.

Double click on the exe and choose a valid College Football USA '97 ROM and the Editor will open, showing all of the player data for each team. Choose a team you want to edit by selecting it in the dropdown on the upper left. Editor converts ratings from 0-99 to 0-15 so the game can read it. After you're done changing the player data, make sure to click SAVE, the editor is designed to update ONE TEAM AT A TIME. If you edit one team and go on to another without saving, your changes will be lost.

Please contact me with any bugs or anything else you would like to see in the Editor. Let me know if anyone would like any of the other versions of the College/Walsh Football games included in the editor.  As of right now, this will only work with College Football USA '97.
